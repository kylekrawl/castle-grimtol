------ Draft Notes ------

Crafting Station in Start Room:

What a fine mess I'm in! It's been nearly a week days since those three went
absolutely mad and I'm at a complete loss as to how to escape this place. Good
thing I got that letter out before the whole place sealed up. I've set up a work
station at the main entry, as it seems those vile things don't come in here. The
decor must not be to their liking (can't say I blame them...those tapestries are
just garish).

It's just a basic setup, but it should be good enough for alchemical recipes that require
only two components. It seems that the bits left behind by the creatures those morons
created are reasonably reactive, thankfully, so I should have plenty of resources as 
long as I can keep killing them.

Purification Line Kiln Room:

I think Aldric was the first to snap. That man was obsessed with all the 'flaws'
he saw in the nature of humanity, and I think he got it into his head that
mastering alchemical purification would help him come to terms with that. Or something
of that nature, honestly hard to tell exactly what that fool was trying to do. Once he started
building those abominations of bone and metal and ranting about their 'inherent perfection'
and 'ideal form,' it was pretty clear he'd no longer respond to reason.

But it seems he's already gone off into that alternate plane with the others. Some manner of pocket
universe spawned by their experiments. The same one that's probably causing the breakdown
of reality around this castle. At least he left behind a portal of sorts. Just gotta find a way to unlock it.

Sadly, that's proving tricky. That man behind left a trail of puzzles to protect it (definitely something
only a madman would do, come to think). I know the trail starts at this old kiln. It's got plenty of
alchemical residue left behind. If I can combine that with something, maybe it'll be useful as fuel
for the kiln. Maybe I'll go kill one of those abominations of his and see if it leaves behind anything useful...

PL Furnace Room:

Okay, got the furnace working. I better hurry before this whole place reconfigures itself...reality is definitely a
bit unstable at the moment. How in the blazes am I going to use this thing? Time to go looking for something useful. While
I'm at it, I should probably craft something to deal with all the traps around here. Maybe I'll mix a Reactive Solid with a Pulse Crystal? 
Yeah, that should work. Now where did I put that Pulse Crystal...

PL Safe Room:

Who fills a safe with concrete!? I guess Aldric *is* technically insane at this point, so I shouldn't be surprised.
But this means there's gotta be something useful in here. Looks like a pretty shoddy job, too. I'll just whip up something explosive. 
A Reactive Solid would make a good base. Maybe I'll just combine it with some of that weird dust I keep finding... 

PL Torch Room:

PL Statue Room:

...that was close. Note to self: Grab some of that stuff from the \\\{Heal Room}\\\ before trying that again...

CL Pool Room:

No luck getting to Aldric...even with the antivenom that statue nearly killed me. And I was so close!
No matter. I'll just have to track Mirinda down instead. Although she scares me even more than Aldric. She wasn't really all
that sane to begin with...I guess having your daughter die suddenly will do that to you. Still, her obsession with the process of alchemical
decay was a bit unnerving. Never seen someone revel quite so much in toxins. I guess the bitterness over losing Vivian turned into a hatred for life itself. 
But then again I'm no expert on the human mind.

Not sure exactly how to find her, but all my investigations point to this room as a decent starting point.
Thought I saw something in that pool, but that stuff looks pretty corrosive. Might be able to burn it away with something. I'll
have to tinker around with all that stuff I have lying around from Aldric's abominations...they seem to produce stuff that
works pretty well against Miranda's creations.

TL Start Room:

Well, looks like Theodore's left our cozy little plane as well. At least he was kind enough to leave behind a portal like the others.
Just have to find out how to reopen it. I have to say, I'm a bit worried. Theodore was clever...possibly my greatest pupil, and his quick
mastery of alchemical transmutation was almost shocking. Even in the end, when he started babbling about unlocking the secrets of the universe
and uncovering the true structure of reality, his rants were at least *somewhat* coherent. But of course, he started creating horrible creatures
and then stepped outside of the universe, just like the others. Makes me wonder if my teaching methodology is a bit rusty...

But I digress. The most logical place to start looking for the key is here. But I haven't the foggiest idea what to do. Theodore, you tricky little...

Purity burns away decay...decay corrodes purity...the chaos of transmutation disrupts itself
