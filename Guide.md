# Speedrun Guide

### Overview

Winning the game requires you to complete three separate questlines (`Purification`, `Corruption`, `Transmutation`) consisting of a themed series of puzzles followed by a boss battle.
These can be completed in any order. 

After defeating the boss at the end of each questline, you'll receive the items needed to unlock the endgame scene.

If you die at any point (Game Over screen), you'll return to the start screen, where you'll have the option to `Continue` your current game. Currently, dying does not reset
combat events (if an enemy kills you, you can continue fighting them by navigating to the room in which you died.)

If you die during a puzzle, it will be reset. When you return to said puzzle room, you will have to `Use` the proper item to start the puzzle again.

The map is a 6 rooms tall x 7 rooms wide grid. The paths below will provide the x (0 to 6) and y (0 to 5) coordinates for each room. (x = 0, y = 0) is the room at the map's SW corner.

Although a given room will always be at the same grid position on the map, the passages between them are randomly generated (the exact path between rooms will change
between playthroughs).

If you need to kill additional enemies for the items they drop, you can respawn all of them by `Rest`-ing in the `Main Foyer` room (x = 1, y = 0).

In each path below, start at the first room listed and proceed as instructed from there.
